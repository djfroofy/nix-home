# nix-home
Nix home-manager configuration for my computers.

To recreate home on another machine run:

    ./install.sh

Log out and log back in and run:

    ./install-post.sh


This is mostly tested on NixOS 19.03 along with the following configuration: https://github.com/djfroofy/nix-configuration
On other Linux systems, ymmv definitely.
